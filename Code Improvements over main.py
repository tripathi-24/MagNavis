Summary of work on MagNavis_v2.py, along with a comparison to main.py and a highlight of the enhancements:


1. Robust Error Handling
- Added checks throughout the code to ensure the program does **not crash** if data is not loaded or columns are not selected.
- User-friendly error messages (using `QMessageBox`) are shown if the user tries to process, visualize, or select columns without loading/selecting data.

2. Dropdown Functionality Restored and Enhanced
- Data Processing Tools** and **Visualization dropdowns were restored to full working order, matching the original logic from `main.py`.
- All dialogs for parameter entry (e.g., for Low Pass Filter, Time Lag Correction, Residual Mag Anomaly) are now functional.
- The Visualization dropdown now supports all advanced options, including:
  - Residual Anomaly & AS (side-by-side plots)
  - AS 3D Plot (both matplotlib and Plotly 3D surface)
  - AS on Map (interactive Plotly map)

3. Plotly Integration Improved
- For interactive 3D and map visualizations, Plotly figures now open in the **web browser** (`renderer="browser"`), ensuring compatibility and avoiding Jupyter/nbformat errors.

4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed a `TypeError` in the anomaly detection method descriptions by ensuring all descriptions are strings (not tuples), so HTML descriptions display correctly.
- Ensured `app.exec_()` is only called once, preventing event loop errors.

5. Code Consistency and Clean-up
- The code structure and logic for data processing and visualization are now consistent with the original `main.py`, but with improved error handling and user experience.

Enhancements in MagNavis_v2.py Over main.py

- Much more robust to user error (no more crashes if data/columns are missing).
- Better user experience with clear, actionable error messages.
- Plotly visualizations are now reliable in all environments (no Jupyter dependency).
- All dropdowns and dialogs work as intended, including advanced visualizations.
- Cleaner, more maintainable code with improved consistency.

In `MagNavis_v3.py`, the Analytic Signal Generation feature (in the `apply_analytic_signal` method) does the following:

1. Retrieves the selected channel from the dropdown.
2. Computes the analytic signal of the selected data column using the Hilbert transform (`scipy.signal.hilbert`). The analytic signal is a complex signal where:
   - The real part is the original signal.
   - The imaginary part is the Hilbert transform of the signal.
3. Extracts and stores the following in new columns of `self.filtered_data`:
   - The real part (`_Analytic_Real`)
   - The imaginary part (`_Analytic_Imag`)
   - The envelope (magnitude, `_Envelope`)
   - The instantaneous phase (`_Phase`)
4. Closes the dialog and plots the envelope (magnitude) of the analytic signal for the selected channel.

Summary:
This tool allows users to generate and visualize the analytic signal (envelope and phase) of any numeric data channel, which is useful for signal analysis, especially in geophysics and magnetic data processing.

                                                                                                                     
MagNavis_v3.py
The following new methods have been added to the "Data Processing Tools" dropdown in your app:

- High Pass Filter
- Band Pass Filter
- Outlier Removal
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Rolling Statistics
- Normalization/Standardization

Each method now has its own dialog for user input, following the style of this existing tools. The processing logic for each is currently a stub (shows a success message)—you can now fill in the actual data processing code for each as needed.

Here’s a more detailed summary of all the work and improvements we accomplished on 02 Jul 25:

---

Detailed Summary of  Work:

1. PCA Tool Debugging and Refactoring
- Problem: The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature in our application was causing the program to crash after submitting the dialog.
- Actions Taken:
  - Refactored the PCA dialog to use local variables for widgets, preventing conflicts with other dialogs.
  - Moved all PCA logic into the dialog’s OK button callback, ensuring clean separation and preventing accidental overwrites.
  - Added robust error handling: now, if the user input is invalid or the PCA computation fails, a clear error message is shown instead of crashing the app.
  - Added input validation: checks that the number of components is valid, all selected columns are numeric, and there is enough data after dropping NaNs.
- Result: The PCA tool is now stable, user-friendly, and provides helpful feedback for any issues.

2. Major Expansion of Visualization Capabilities
We greatly enhanced the “Data Visualization” dropdown menu, making our app a much more powerful tool for data exploration and analysis. Here are the new visualizations added:

a. Heatmap of Magnetic Values
- What it does: Interpolates and visualizes the density of magnetic values as a heatmap over the geographic area.
- Benefit: Quickly highlights regions of high or low magnetic activity, making spatial patterns easy to spot.

b. Cluster Map (K-Means)
- What it does: Uses K-Means clustering to group similar data points and colors them on the map, with cluster centers marked.
- Benefit: Identifies spatial patterns or regions with similar magnetic characteristics, useful for geophysical interpretation.

c. Correlation Matrix Heatmap
- What it does: Plots a heatmap of the correlation coefficients between all numeric columns in your dataset.
- Benefit: Shows relationships between different measured variables (e.g., altitude, magnetic value, time), helping to identify dependencies or redundancies.

d. Histogram/Distribution Plot
- What it does: Prompts the user to select a numeric column and displays its histogram.
- Benefit:Reveals the distribution, skewness, and outliers for any variable, aiding in statistical analysis.

e. Cross-Sectional Profile
- What it does: Prompts for start and end coordinates, then plots the magnetic values along that line using interpolation.
- Benefit: Allows you to analyze subsurface features or trends along a specific transect, which is valuable for geologists and geophysicists.

f. Interactive Map with Tooltips
- What it does: Opens an interactive map (using folium) where each point shows details (magnetic value, time, residual anomaly) on hover or click.
- Benefit: Makes data exploration more intuitive and interactive, allowing you to inspect individual data points easily.

3. General Improvements and User Experience
- All new visualizations are robust, with clear error messages for insufficient data or invalid input.
- The dropdown menu is now much more versatile, supporting both spatial and statistical exploration of your data.
- The app is now more user-friendly, interactive, and suitable for both quick looks and in-depth analysis.

 a significantly more powerful and flexible data analysis tool, capable of advanced geospatial, statistical, and time series visualizations. The improvements make it easier to explore, interpret, and present our magnetic anomaly data.

Here is a comprehensive comparison of the three main Python scripts in your project: `main.py`, `MagNavis_v2.py`, and `MagNavis_v3.py`. All three are large PyQt5-based GUI applications for magnetic navigation data analysis, but they differ in features, code structure, and maturity.

---

1. Core Structure and Purpose

- main.py:  
  - The original or baseline version.
  - Implements a full-featured GUI for magnetic data analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.
  - Contains a single main class `MagnavisApp` with all logic.

- MagNavis_v2.py:  
  - An improved/refactored version of `main.py`.
  - Retains the same class structure and most features, but with some bug fixes, improved error handling, and more robust user input validation.
  - Some features (like Analytic Signal Generation) are marked as "not yet implemented" or are placeholders.

- MagNavis_v3.py:  
  - The most advanced and feature-rich version.
  - Adds more data processing tools, more anomaly detection methods, and a wider range of visualization options.
  - Includes advanced features like PCA, normalization/standardization, outlier removal, rolling statistics, and more.
  - Improved UI/UX, more parameter controls, and better modularization.
